                <hr>

                <p>Association football, more commonly known as simply football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played
                    with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million
                    players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game
                    is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is
                    to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing
                    goal, usually within a time frame of 90 or more minutes</p>
